# Chapter 2.1: Naming {#statements}

### Underscores

#### One at the Start

Using one underscore at the start of a name will make that object protected.

It can still be used outside of the object, but it won't be picked up by documentation.

#### Two at the Start

Using two underscores at the start of the name will make that object class-private.

It will not be able to be used outside of the object, but can still be used inside the object.

#### Two at the Start and Two at the End

Two at the start and the end is usually saved for built-in classes and has no real use outside of them.
