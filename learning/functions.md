# Chapter 3.8: Functions {#functions}

#### What is a Function?

A function is a command that can be used to perform an/or multiple actions. They can contain however many lines of code you would like, and can be used however many times by just calling it.

#### Why Should I Use Functions? {#why-should-i-use-variables}

Using functions will decrease the the amount of coding needed.

If you want to run multiple lines of code multiple times, then putting that code into a function will reduce the lines needed to 1. It also means that you can update the code run easily.

## Arguments {#arguments}

#### What is an Argument?

An argument is something that can be passed into a function to then be used inside of the function.

```py
def my_function(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
    
my_function("Harry")
```

This function will print, "Hello, Harry!". Since we passed the string, "Harry" into the function.
