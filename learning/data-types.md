## Numeric {#numeric}

A numberic data type contains a number, like 1942302. For example

```python
PI = 3
```

PI will now contain the number 3 which can now be used in calculating stuff

### Boolean {#boolean}

A boolean can be in 2 states, true or false.
A boolean can be the answer to a question or statement,
for example:

Booleans are mostly used in if, while, for, etc loops, these loops will only run if the value is true

```python
if(is_user_bot):
  print("User is a bot!")
```

will print "User is a bot!" if IsUserBot is true

### Float {#float}

Float is like a numeric number as explained above but it has decimals, for example if you wanted more specific calculations you can do

```python
PI = 3.14
```
