## Using Variables

To use a variable, the variable must first be defined. After that, it may be called.

### Defining Variables

To define a variable, you simply write it's name followed by an equals sign and then the value the variable will have.

```py
my_variable = "A simple String."
```

Now, the variable, "my\_variable" may be called from the code.
