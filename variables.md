# Chapter 2: Variables

#### What is a Variable?

A variable is essentially a label for a value. They contain a piece of data.

A variable can contain any data type. For instance, a variable can contain a list.

#### Why Should I Use Variables?

Variables help improve readability of code, and can reduce the amount of coding needed.

## Using Variables

To use a variable, the variable must first be defined. After that, it may be called.

### Defining Variables

To define a variable, you simply write it's name followed by an equals sign and then the value the variable will have.

```py
my_variable = "A simple string."
```

Now, the variable, "my\_variable" may be called from the code.

### Changing Variables

Changing a variable is a lot like defining it, in fact, it's no different from.

```py
my_variable = "A simple string."
my_variable = "A different string."
```

The first line will create the variable and give it the value, and the second line will change the value of the variable.

### Calling Variables

To call a variable, you simply write the name of it where you would like it to be used.

```py
my_variable = "A simple string."
print(my_variable)
```

This will print, "A simple string." to the terminal.
